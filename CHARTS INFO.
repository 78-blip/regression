# Data Vizualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts : Understand the relationships between variables
# CONCLUSIONS OUT OF CHARTS 

 # CHART 1
here the approx200-500 no.of bikes are in greatest frequency.

hereby the demand of rented bikes

there are various trends of demand in the chart.

0-1000 bikes demand is most frequent

1000-2000 bikes are somehow mediocre in demand

2000-3000 are less in demand

3000-4000 are too invisible and are rarely occured.

 # CHART 2
demand is high at 0,8,18,19 hours of the day.

demand is comparitively high in range of temperature15-25 degree celcius

humidity 30-70 show steep bike demand

wind speed1-3 n/s shows high bike demand.

for more visibility ,demand is high

lesser the snowfall ,rainfall,solar radiation,more the rented bike demand.

# CHART 3
demand is high at 0,8,18,19 hours of the day.

demand is comparitively high in range of temperature15-25 degree celcius

humidity 30-70 show steep bike demand

wind speed1-3 n/s shows high bike demand.

for more visibility ,demand is high

lesser the snowfall ,rainfall,solar radiation,more the rented bike demand.

# CHART 4

5-15 hours are our most frequent hours ,rest all outliers.

7-23 degree celcius is our normal temperature in which bike are rented commonly.

40-70 is our common humidity.

average wind sped is 1-2

visibility is 800-2000

solar radiation is 0.0-1.0 is most commin

snowfall and rainfall are not significant

# CHART 5
temperature is correlated to mediocre degree to rented bijes demand.

humidity is corelated to visibility and solar radiation.

rest most of the variables show little or no dependency .

hereby keeping in mind the variables we can try to manipulate each other from business prospect.
