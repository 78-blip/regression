# DATA MANIPULATIONS
HANDLING OUTLIERS:
THE TECHNIQUE I USED FOR REMOVING OUTLIERS INVOLVES FOLLOWING STEPS:

FIRST WE HAVE ALREADY MADE BOXPLOT AND HISTOGRAM IN CHARTS FROM WHERE WE GET TO KNOW ALL COMMON RANGE AND OUTLIERS

NOW WE HAVE MADE NEW DATASET TO INCLUDE ALL VARIABLES BY USING FLITERS

THIS TECHNIQUE IS SOMEHOW SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE.

# CATEGORICAL ENCODING
firstly ,i have created a copy of my dataset in order to encode categorical variables to numeric.

tgen we have make a code where by we haveassigned the numercic values to each category of categorical data

then we have replaced the values

# FEATURE MANIPULATION AND SELECTION
hereby firstly i have selected the important numerical features of my dataset to work upon :

hereby i have excluded the categorical features already .

also i have combined the temperature and excluded twice varaibles to avoid mulricollinearity.


The important features according to me are:

1.'Rented Bike Count', 'Hour','Humidity(%)', 'Wind speed (m/s)', 'Visibility (10m)','overall_temperature' 'Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)', 'Rainfall(mm)', 'Snowfall (cm)']

as they all are important in drawing the conclusions about my prediction .they all are numerical data at all and contains important aspect

# DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION:
i have used feature selection technique to fliter the variables i need:

it facilitates the working on dataset

it concentrate the focus on important things.

it helps i prediaction very well
