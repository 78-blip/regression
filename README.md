# REGRESSION PROJECT-BIKE SHARIND DEMAND PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION AND REGULARIZED RINEAR REGRESSION

# DATA:
HOUR--- GIVES THE HOUR OF THE DAY WHICH MIGHT AFFECT THE BIKES DEMANDED AS PEOPLE PREFER TRAVELLING IN PARTICULAR HOURS

TEMP.---GIVES THE TENPERATURE OF THE TIME SO AS TO GET A LINK BETWEEN IT AND DEMAND.

HUMIDITY---GIVES THE HUMIDITY % IN THE AIR WHICH MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND

WIND SPEED---GIVES THE SPEED IN M/S AS NOT EVERY WIND MOVEMENT IS RIDE PREFERABLE

VISISBILITY---GIVES THE VISIBILITY AS BLURY ENVT IS NOT RIDE PREFERABLE

SOLAR RADIATION-----GIVES THE SOLAR RADIATION AS NOT EVERY RADIATION IS RIDE PREFERABLE

RAINFALL----GIVES THE RAINFALL IN MM AS NOT EVERY DEGREE IS RIDE PREFERABLE

SNOWFALL---GIVES THE SNOWFALL AS NOT EVERY DEGREE IS RIDE PREFERABLE

SEASON---GIVES THE PARTICULAR SEASON OF THE BIKE DEMAND AS IT MAY IMPACT CERTAINLY

HOLIDAY---IT SURELY AFFECTS THE DEMAND OF BIKES AS IN HOLIDAYS PEOPLE DONT HAVE TO MOVE FOR WORK BUT FOR TRAVELLING'

FUNCTIONING DAY---IT ALSO AFFCETS HUGELY AS IT GIVES WHETHER FUNCTIONALITY IS OPEN

# PROJECT SUMMARY:

HEREBY ,I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE DATASET OF BIKES DEMAND PREDICTION ON THE BASIS OF VARIOUS VARIABLES GIVEN ,OUR GOAL HERE INVOLVES FOLLOWING:

TO GO THROUGH EACH VARIABLE AND UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF THEM AGGREGATELY

TO DRAW IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS REGARDING VARIABLES AND THEIR DEPENDENCY.

TO SHOW WORKINGS THROUGH VISUALIZATIONS.

TO MAKE DATA MORE EXPLICIT.

TO SHOW PREDICTION OF VARIABLES ,THROUGH TRAIN TEST MODEL.

TO USE LASSO ,RIDGE TO OVERCOME OVERFITTING IN MODELS.


# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
HERE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO UNDERSTAND AND GENERATE THE DEPENDENCY OF BIKE DEMANDS PER HOUR ON THE BASIS OF VARIOUS FACTORS LIKE TEMPERATURE,HUMIDITY.
SO WE WILL BE CO RELATING THE VARIABLES TO GENERATE OUR MODEL WHICH WILL FIT IN THE GIVEN DATASET TO GIVE GIVE AN APPROX IDEA WHILE FIXING THE OVERFITTING.


# LINEAR REGRESSION:
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

# REGULARIZED LINEAR REGRESSION:
Regularization is a way of controlling the complexity of a linear regression model, by penalizing the coefficients that are not important or relevant for the prediction. By doing so, regularization can reduce the variance of the model, as it prevents overfitting and makes the model more robust to noise and outliers
