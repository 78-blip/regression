Hereby we can conclude the following points by working on our dataset :

1.There is positive degree correlation of some extent in temperature and dew point temperature.

2.There is positive degree correlation of some extent in rainfall and visibility.

3.hereby we are to prepare a model which predicts independent variables to some accuracy.

4.no. of hours and temperature had a great impact on dependent variable hereby rented bike count.

5.here no. of hours is something in our hand so we can adjust it in some ways or other for rented bike count.

6.rented bike count has almost no correlation with wind speed.

7.our models give us a good level of accuracy here.
